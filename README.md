# Predict Customer Churn - with Spark for python.

The Capstone project for [Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). This project involves predicting customer churn for a hypothetical music streaming app Sparkify, using Spark's MLlib to engineer features and build a classification model. The dataset used here is a medium-sized (248 MB, with 548,000 rows) version of the whole dataset (which is 12 GB). <br>
This project is worked on [IBM Cloud's Watson Studio](https://www.ibm.com/se-en/cloud/watson-studio), uploading the data cluster, with a Python 3.7/Spark 3.0 enabled Jupyter Notebook. <br>
